Gordo has been struggling with his weight for years, only now has he learned that he is gravely ill. If he does not change his ways, he will surely meet an early grave at the hands of his cravings. Armed initially with a spork, help Gordo battle against temptation as he faces some delectable enemies. First run through too easy? Try 'Calorie Burner' mode on your second try, it'll have your palms sweating!

Type "fat" to be transported to the levels boss.
Type "smash" to instantly win the level.

Game has no bugs that we are currently aware of, though testing probably wasn't as thorough as we would've liked it to have been.
